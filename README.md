## Example Insights

### Top Chocolate Manufacturers
| Manufacturer Name  | Average Rating     |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| Amedei             | 4.00               |
| Soma               | 3.95               |
| Bonnat             | 3.89               |

### Cocoa Percentage vs. Ratings
- Higher cocoa percentages (70-85%) tend to receive above-average ratings, though some lower-percentage chocolates also perform well based on flavor balance and craftsmanship.

### Ratings Distribution
- Visual analysis of the most frequent rating categories across the dataset.
